## Project Overview 
This project is an analysis of food waste data from various countries. The dataset includes food waste amounts across different sectors (household, retail, and food service) measured in tonnes per year and per capita. My goal is to identify trends, highlight key insights, and visualize the distribution of food waste globally.
## Data Source
The data for this analysis is sourced from the Kaggle website, which provides a comprehensive dataset on food waste by country. This dataset includes information on food waste across various sectors (household, retail, and food service) and per capita metrics.
## Analysis
## Key Analysis Questions
The project addresses the following key questions:
- Top 10 Countries with the Highest Food Waste:
  Visualized in a bar chart showing the top 10 countries based on total food waste across all sectors.
- Top 10 Countries with the Lowest Food Waste:
  Similar to the above, but highlights the countries with the least total food waste.
- Total Food Waste by Sector:
  Calculated the total food waste in household, retail, and food service sectors to understand the distribution of waste across these sectors.
## Findings
- Top 10 Countries with the Highest Food Waste:
   The analysis reveals that the top 10 countries account for a substantial portion of global food waste, highlighting significant disparities in waste levels. This concentration of       waste among a few countries may indicate areas for targeted policy intervention.
- Top 10 Countries with the Lowest Food Waste:
   The countries with the lowest food waste contribute minimally to the global total. These nations may have more efficient consumption and waste management practices, possibly            influenced by cultural or economic factors.
- Total Food Waste by Sector:
   The household sector is the largest contributor to food waste globally, followed by retail and food service. This breakdown suggests that consumer behavior at the household level       plays a critical role in overall waste generation. Understanding this can help in designing programs focused on reducing waste in homes.
## Additional Insights
The analysis includes other derived insights, such as the per capita waste for various countries and a breakdown of food waste by region, which provides a broader perspective on food waste patterns globally.
## Visualizations
- Bar Charts:
   We use bar charts to visualize food waste amounts for the top and bottom countries, helping to quickly identify countries with the most      and least food waste.
## Usage
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
## Conclusion
This analysis underscores global disparities in food waste, particularly among countries and sectors. The findings suggest that targeted strategies to reduce waste in high-waste countries and in household sectors could significantly impact global food waste levels.

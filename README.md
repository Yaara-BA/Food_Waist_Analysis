## Project Overview 
This project is an analysis of food waste data from various countries. The dataset includes food waste amounts across different sectors (household, retail, and food service) measured in tonnes per year and per capita. My goal is to identify trends, highlight key insights, and visualize the distribution of food waste globally.

## Data Source
The data used in this project includes columns such as:
- Country: The name of the country.
- Household estimate (tonnes/year): Annual household food waste in tonnes.
- Retail estimate (tonnes/year): Annual retail food waste in tonnes.
- Food service estimate (tonnes/year): Annual food service waste in tonnes.
- combined figures (kg/capita/year): Combined food waste per capita, measured in kg/year.
- Confidence in estimate: Confidence level for the data estimate.
- Region: Geographical region of the country.

## Key Analysis Questions
The project addresses the following key questions:
- Top 10 Countries with the Highest Food Waste:
  Visualized in a bar chart showing the top 10 countries based on total food waste across all sectors.
- Top 10 Countries with the Lowest Food Waste:
  Similar to the above, but highlights the countries with the least total food waste.
- Total Food Waste by Sector:
  Calculated the total food waste in household, retail, and food service sectors to understand the distribution of waste across these sectors.
